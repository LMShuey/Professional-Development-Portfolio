# Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering Module 1 Log

**Completed**: February 2026  
**Source**: Vanderbilt University – "Prompt Engineering for Everyone" (Coursera)

## Main Idea
The course demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) are capable of far more than search or basic generation — they can tackle complex tasks humans find challenging. The presenter shows how small prompt adjustments (wording, structure, iteration) dramatically improve, focus, or expand outputs.

## What Surprised Me
How much output quality improves with just a few well-chosen words or added instructions — prompting is a skill that rewards small, iterative tweaks.

## My Take
Engaging and practical course. The video format, readings, and quizzes work well for me — better than reading alone. Prompting tips are immediately usable. The presenter's encouragement to iterate freely reminded me how much I've improved at that with Grok — early reluctance is gone. This course helped cement concepts from the Google AI Essentials course I completed last week.

## Q&A / Discussion Highlights
- Viewing LLMs as valued collaborators (not just tools) improves prompt quality.
- Iterations are now natural — Grok's patient style helped eliminate the old "failure" feeling.
- Signed up for ChatGPT for course exercises but paused — it required a paid trial and wouldn't allow free sign-up. May use Grok equivalents if needed.

## Key Takeaways
- Prompting is iterative — small changes yield big improvements.
- Treat LLMs as collaborators to get better results.
- Practical foundation that builds on prior AI courses.

This log is exploratory and self-directed. Focused on practical prompting skills and responsible application.
Randomness in model outputs is normal — nothing works every single time.

Overall notes on Module 1
Informative course with strong presenter. No heavy exercises or coding. It gave a good foundation for prompting and output evaluation. The multi-format approach (video + quizzes + cert) cements learning better than reading-only.

Disclosure: I collaborate with Grok on many things and did so once again on this report.
