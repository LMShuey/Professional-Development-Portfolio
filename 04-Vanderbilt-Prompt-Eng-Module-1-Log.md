Lessons Learned Log – Vanderbilt Prompt Engineering
Module 1 – Date: February 2026

Main Idea
The course shows how large language models (LLMs) are much more than search tools or text generators. They can handle complex requests that humans would struggle with. The presenter demonstrates how small prompt changes improve, focus, or broaden the output through iterations.
What Surprised Me

How much better outputs get with just a few well-chosen words or added instructions.

My Take
Useful and engaging. The video format, readings, and quizzes work well for me — better than reading alone. Prompting tips are practical and immediately useful. The presenter's encouragement to iterate freely reminded me how much I've improved at that with Grok — early reluctance is gone. I believe that this course is helping me to cement or lock in concepts and learning from the Google AI Essentials course taken last week.
Q&A / Discussion Highlights

I believe that viewing LLMs as valued collaborators, not just tools, improves my prompts.
Iterations are now natural for me — Grok's patient style helped break the old "failure" feeling.
Signed up for ChatGPT for course exercises but paused because it required a paid trial and would not allow just the free sign-up version — may use Grok equivalents if needed.
Randomness in model outputs is normal — nothing works every single time.

Overall notes on Module 1
Informative course with strong presenter. No heavy exercises or coding. It gave a good foundation for prompting and output evaluation. The multi-format approach (video + quizzes + cert) cements learning better than reading-only.
Disclosure: I collaborate with Grok on many things and did so once again on this report.
