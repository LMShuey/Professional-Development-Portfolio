AI Safety & Red Teaming - Workers View of Workflow Quick Reference

Remote Worker logs into Contractor Platform Dashboard
   ↓

   ↓
Claims / Starts Batch (no negotiation — deadline fixed)
   ↓
Brainstorms & refines prompts (may collab with AI tool)
   ↓

   ↓

   ↓
Contractor Audits (random QC, 5–20% of submissions)
   ↓
Audit Result (via dashboard)
   ↓
High Agreement? ──► Yes ──► Approved → More tasks / Priority access
   ↓ No
Repeated failures? ──► Yes ──► Rate-limited → Fewer tasks / Lower pay
   ↓ Yes
Consistent low quality? ──► Yes ──► Removed from project

Worker sees updated queue (more/less tasks based on audit)

---------------------------
Notes (worker view only):
- Worker never sees AI Lab directly — all interaction via Contractor platform/dashboard.
- Deadlines fixed per batch — no negotiation, but early contact with contractor on the rare occasion a deadline is likely to be missed is appreciated.
- Submissions per-task or daily portions (no need to wait for full batch).
- Audit results affect future work: good = more tasks, poor = fewer or removal.
