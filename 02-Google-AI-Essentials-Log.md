Collaboration Note: All content developed collaboratively with Grok. I completed the course, asked questions, and reflected; Grok helped clarify concepts and explain in plain terms.
Main Idea
The course gives a basic overview of AI today. It covers what AI is, how generative AI works, using prompts effectively, responsible AI (ethics, bias, safety), and practical uses (productivity tools, image generation, automation). It focuses on non-technical understanding for everyday people and professionals.
What Surprised Me

How much AI relies on simple prompting tricks — small wording changes can make outputs much better or worse.
Responsible AI is emphasized heavily (bias, privacy, hallucinations, environmental impact), but real-world fixes still feel incomplete.
Generative tools like image creation and text-to-video are farther along than I thought, but they still have obvious limits and errors.

Glitches / Circuit Breakers Pulled

Hallucinations sometimes happened until I learned that it's the AI confidently making up facts because it predicts patterns, not because it "knows" truth.

My Take
Useful introduction. It feels like a tour of current AI tools and risks. The prompting section is the most practical part — small changes in how you ask can make a big difference. Responsible AI discussions are good reminders, but they don't solve the problems yet. The course helped me see AI as a tool that needs careful handling, not magic.
Q&A Highlights (intensive discussions we had)

What is generative AI? — It creates new text, images, code from patterns learned in training data.
How do prompts work? — Clear, specific prompts with role, examples, step-by-step instructions give better results.
One reason may be that AIs hallucinate? — They predict the next word based on patterns, not facts — so they can confidently invent things.
Responsible AI concerns? — Bias in training data, privacy leaks, environmental cost of training, misuse for deepfakes or misinformation.
Practical uses? — Summarizing documents, brainstorming ideas, generating images for concepts, automating repetitive tasks.
Limitations? — Still makes mistakes, lacks real understanding, can't truly reason or learn like humans.

Overall notes
This was an informative course with no heavy exercises or coding. It gave a solid foundation for understanding current AI capabilities and risks. The Q&A with Grok helped fill gaps and make concepts clearer.
